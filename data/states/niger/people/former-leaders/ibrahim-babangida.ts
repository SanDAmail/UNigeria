    legacyAndImpact: "Babangida's regime is one of the most controversial in Nigerian history. He is credited with liberalizing the economy through SAP and overseeing the construction of key infrastructure. However, his tenure was also marked by a decline in living standards for many, accusations of widespread corruption, and a crackdown on dissent. The annulment of the June 12 election remains his most defining and contentious legacy, a political crisis that deeply affected Nigeria for years.",
