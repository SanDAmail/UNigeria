        'His 83-day tenure as Head of the Interim National Government was too short and politically unstable for the initiation or completion of any capital projects.',

    ],
    legacyAndImpact: "Shonekan's tenure is a short but significant chapter in Nigeria's political history. He was appointed to lead a transitional government meant to guide the country to a new democratic election following the annulment of the June 12 vote. However, his government lacked broad legitimacy and military support, making it unstable and ultimately short-lived. His brief period in power represents a critical and turbulent moment in the struggle for democracy in Nigeria.",
