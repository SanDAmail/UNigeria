    legacyAndImpact: "Aguiyi-Ironsi's short-lived regime marked Nigeria's first-ever military rule. His most significant and controversial act was the Unification Decree, which was seen by some northern leaders as an attempt to centralize power and was a major factor leading to the counter-coup that cost him his life. His rule represents the volatile and tragic beginning of military intervention in Nigerian politics.",
